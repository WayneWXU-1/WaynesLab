        <p>Hi my name is Wayne, this is my first attempt at building my website with HTML and CSS, I hope this project tells others a little more about myself. 
        Currently im attending the University of British Columbia majoring in Engineering. When im not stressing over exams and homework, 
        you can find me running, making edits or taking photos of nature. Learning mathematics and physics in Highschool pushed me to pursue the application of sciences. I enjoy problem solving, learning new skills
        and trying my best even when things get tough!</p>
