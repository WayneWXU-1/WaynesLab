            Autonomous Claw
        </h3>
        

        

        <div class = "container">
            <div class = "box"><p>For this course project our team was tasked with creating an autonomous claw to order to pick up various different items from the ocean floor, 
                in the end there would be a competition. By using the engineering design process we followed the following steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Study and Clarify the Problem</li>
                <li>Generate potential Solutions</li>
                <li>Identify the most Promising Solution</li>
                <li>Implment solution/Reiterate</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class ="box"><p>Similar to most design processes, we did a stakeholder consultation and from that determined an evaluation criteria 
                and requirement guideline. Following this we made several prototype designs and rapid C-sketchs. In the end we went with a design similar to the right, this was made by
            Adriano.</p><br>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <div id = "box4">
            <p>The results were actually not the best, in fact we actually did extremely poorly in the competition due to the servo reaction time, however, I think that despite the drawback, it
            strengthened the team to work even harder on future projects, and was an extremely valuable lesson. Overall this claw project was extremely memorable and enjoyable in comparison to other projects.
            Big shout out to my team that did alot of the heavy lifting and making the course feasible.
