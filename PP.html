        <div class = "box5"><p>I got tired of putting my earbuds in my pocket and it becoming a tangeled mess within five seconds and untangling them, as a result I designed this earbud holder.<br>
            As a way to hold earbuds I produced a series of prototypes (lost them) and went through a design process to find the optimal size. My first one was similar to a donut and was too small to fit the entire wire, and my second one was structurally unstable and broke. 
            I ended up with this two hole donut design, if I did use wires, this would ensure all that the wires were untangled and the structure was stable. This was made in sketchup then 3d printed</p>

        <h1>Waterhose Adapter</h1>
        <p>This is a prototype on Solidworks of a waterhose attachment that should make watering hoses for those with a hand impairment more accesible, our group designed several designs on solidworks, fortunatly a better model moved forward as was presented.</p>

            <div class = "box"><p><h2>What it does<br></h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Attachs to the head of a standard commercial waterhose<br></li>
                <li>A torque or rotation would be applied on one side of the system and since the screw is attached to the waterhose it would change the settings<br></li>
                <li>Makes watering the garden accessible for everyone<br></li>
                </ul>   
            </p>
            </div>


            <div class = "box"><p><h2>How it works<br></h2>
                <ul>
                <li>By applying a torque on one side it would turn the settings on the hose<br></li>
                <li>The attachment can be easily attached by removing then reattaching the screw<br></li>
                <li>It would likely need to be water jet cutted out of some metal material to ensure structural stability<br></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "box"><p><h2>What I learned<br></h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Calling homedepot and various supply depots to find the dimensions of what I need, i.e screws, diameters, etc<br></li>
                <li>Using the design process to find the best and most simple problem<br></li>
                <li>This was the 2nd or 3rd time using solidworks, so I learned assembling parts and various different features.<br></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "box"><p><h2>What I would improve<br></h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Making it assemble properly was quite difficult<br></li>
                <li>We didnt actually print this, however I would make sure that it actual fit the commercial waterhose<br></li>
                <li>Produce more models to see physical strains and stress over time<br></li>

        <h1>"Prototype Storage of some sort"</h1>
        <p>This is my first fully individual ardiuno project, initially it was planned to make a garbage can but some difficulty with the hinge the project turned into a servo powered container</p>

            <div class = "box"><p><h2>What it does<br></h2>
                <ul>
                <li>A servo motor rotates opening and closing the lid<br></li>
                <li>A button press triggers the servo to open and close<br></li>
                <li>Essentially a storage space for keys, usbs, small items<br></li>

                <ul>
                <li>Using some jumper wires, arduino, button and breadboard<br></li>
                <li>The servo rotates 180 degrees when button pressed and then 0 degrees when released<br></li>
                <li> Cardboard was used to build the box<br></li>
                <li>An extra peice of cardboard at orthoganal angle was placed to change the rotation on a single axis to rotate like a hinge</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Applying course knowledge into my own arduino design following the design process<br></li>
                <li>Applying lab knowledge of circuit analysis<br></li>

                <ul>
                <li>Moving the hinge to the left or right, this will allow more storage<br></li>
                <li>Using a different material like aluminum sheets<br></li>
                <li>include other systems like a lock with password in the future<br></li>
